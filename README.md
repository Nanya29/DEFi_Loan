# DeFi - Lending Pool & Flash Loan

This project, led by Ayman Alklaqe, Princess Nwabulu, and Evan Grillo, explores decentralized finance (DeFi) through the creation of a lending pool and implementation of flash loans.

## Technologies

The project leverages various technologies including:

- Remix
- Ganache
- Solidity
- Python
- Streamlit
- Web3
- FlashLoanLib

## Summary

Continuing our exploration of blockchain and smart contracts with Solidity, we've developed a contract enabling users to contribute to and borrow from a lending pool. Additionally, we've integrated this contract with a Streamlit app and introduced a Flash Loan contract for executing arbitrage trades.

## Concept

This project serves as an illustration of how smart contracts can facilitate transactions in the decentralized finance landscape.

## Challenges

- Versioning
- Simulating a production environment
- Streamlined testing & updates

## Next Steps

Transition to a Sepolia testnet and import a commercial-grade contract to further enhance the capabilities and robustness of the contract and trading features.
